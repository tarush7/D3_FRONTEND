India will be part of an international contingent of like-minded countries for the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic Games to be held in Paris in July, 2024.India and France have been long-standing strategic partners since the establishment of diplomatic relations between The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) along with the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in 1947, and the upgrading of the partnership to the strategic level in 1998. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) along with the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) completed 25 years of strategic partnership last year which includes the areas of defence and security cooperation, space cooperation and civil nuclear cooperation, according to officials.India has unearthed several Islamic State (IS) and Al Qaeda in Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) modules across India with their international linkages. The elite National Security Guards along with other Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) successfully conducted G-20 events in the national capital, according to North Block officials. France, on the other hand, has witnessed a string of terrorist attacks since 2020, most notably the 'Paris stabbing attack' in September and beheading of Samuel Paty in October France has consistently condemned terrorism and following the Pulwama attack of February 2019, France supported India and nationally listed the Pakistan 'global terrorist' Hafiz Saeed, which was followed up with the listing at the UN, official added. France has also supported India's requests to block attempts by Pakistan to enlist innocent Indian citizens under the UNSC 1267 sanctions committee based on fabricated charges, added another official."

            "articleBigContent": "April 27, 2024 04:35 am | Updated 03:57 pm IST - BHOPAL\n\nUnion Home Minister Amit Shah alleged on Friday that the Congress wanted to “bring back Muslim personal law and triple talaq” and pledged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) across the entire country.\n\nAddressing poll rallies in Madhya Pradesh’s Guna and Rajgarh Lok Sabha constituencies, Mr. Shah said, “Read the Congress manifesto carefully. They have said that we will re-implement the Muslim personal law and triple talaq. You tell me, can this country be run by Sharia [law]? Rahul [Gandhi] baba, do whatever you want to do for appeasement. But as long as the BJP is there, we will not allow [Muslim] personal law to be implemented.”\n\n“This country will be run by UCC, this is the spirit of our Constitution. We have brought UCC in Uttarakhand and it is [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi ji’s guarantee that we will implement UCC across the country,” the BJP leader said, on the same day that second phase polling took place.\n\nTargeting Digvijaya\n\nMr. Shah also claimed that these “promises were added in the Congress manifesto on the advice of [senior Congress leader and Rajgarh candidate] Digvijaya Singh”.\n\n“Modi ji has given first priority to [Scheduled Castes] SCs, [Scheduled Tribes] STs, and [other backward classes] OBCs in the development of this country. But the Congress says that Muslims have the first right on the resources of this country. We will not let the intentions of the Congress be fulfilled,” he said, echoing Mr. Modi’s controversial remarks at a rally in Rajasthan earlier this week.\n\nThe BJP has fielded Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia from Guna to take on the Congress’ Rao Yadvendra Singh, who had switched over from the BJP ahead of the 2023 State Assembly election. Mr. Scindia, who lost the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Guna on a Congress ticket, joined the BJP in March 2020 as he led a rebellion of more than 20 MLAs to bring down the Kamal Nath-led Congress government in the State.\n\nAnother fierce contest is expected in Rajgarh, the home constituency of Mr. Singh, a former M.P. Chief Minister and senior Congress leader. He is challenging the sitting BJP MP Rodmal Nagar.\n\nBoth the constituencies will go to the polls in the third phase on May 7.\n\n‘Back door entry’\n\nAt both rallies, Mr. Shah launched scathing attacks against the Congress over issues ranging from the abrogation of Article 370 and the Ram Temple to Naxalism and terrorism.\n\n“The Congress wants to bring in Sharia law through the back door by talking about personal law. And Diggi Raja [a popular moniker for Mr. Singh] is two steps ahead and talks about bhagwa atankwad (saffron terrorism),” he said.\n\n“He [Mr. Singh] addresses Pakistani terrorist Hafiz Saeed as ‘sahib’. He embraces Zakir Naik. He opposes the death penalty to Afzal Guru who attacked the Parliament and also opposes the ban on the PFI [Popular Front of India],” Mr. Shah said.\n\nThe Home Minister also claimed that Madhya Pradesh had suffered from Naxalism during Mr. Singh’s tenure as CM between 1993 and 2003, adding that it was the BJP government which has now “eradicated” Naxalism from the State.\n\n‘Home turf’\n\nMr. Shah also took some potshots at Mr. Singh for returning to his home parliamentary constituency after 30 years. The Congress leader, who hails from the royal family of Rajgarh’s Raghogarh, had represented the constituency from 1984-89 and 1991-94.\n\n“What mandate are you asking for Diggi Raja? You ran away for so many years, went to Bhopal and now you have returned to Rajgarh. Ask the people here if they want you?” Mr. Shah said, adding that the word “bantadhar (ruined)” has been added to the Congress leader’s name.\n\n“He has come and gone many times. Now the time has come to give him a permanent farewell from politics. People of Rajgarh have to do it,” he said. “You have to ensure his defeat with a huge margin of votes. Defeat him with a lead [matching] his stature and make him sit at home,” he added.\n\nMr. Singh has already announced that this will be his last election as he will soon cross the age of 80 years.",

                "coref": "April 27, 2024 04:35 am | Updated 03:57 pm IST - BHOPAL Singh alleged on Friday that the Congress wanted to bring back the Muslim personal law and triple talaq and pledged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) across the entire country. Addressing poll rallies in Madhya Pradesh''s Guna and Rajgarh Lok Sabha constituencies, Singh said, Read the the Congress manifesto carefully. Congress have said that the Congress will re-implement the Muslim personal law and triple talaq. You tell Mr. Singh, a former M.P. Chief Minister and senior Congress leader, can the entire country be run by Sharia [law]? Rahul [Gandhi] baba, do whatever you want to do for appeasement. But as long as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is there, we will not allow the Muslim personal law to be implemented. the entire country will be run by the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), this is the spirit of our Constitution. We have brought the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in Uttarakhand and it is [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi ji''s guarantee that we will implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) across the entire country, the the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said, on the same day that second phase polling took place. Targeting Digvijaya Singh also claimed that these promises were added in the Congress manifesto on the advice of [senior the Congress leader and Rajgarh Lok Sabha candidate] Digvijaya Singh. Modi has given first priority to [Scheduled Castes] SCs, [Scheduled Tribes] STs, and [other backward classes] OBCs in the development of the entire country. But the Congress says that Muslims have the first right on the resources of the entire country. We will not let the intentions of the Congress be fulfilled, Singh said, echoing Mr. Modi''s controversial remarks at a rally in Rajasthan earlier this week. the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has fielded Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia from Guna to take on the Congress'' Rao Yadvendra Singh, who had switched over from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of the 2023 State Assembly election. Jyotiraditya Scindia, who lost the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Guna on a the Congress ticket, joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in March 2020 as Jyotiraditya Scindia led a rebellion of more than 20 MLAs to bring down the Kamal Nath-led Congress government in the entire country. Another fierce contest is expected in Rajgarh, the home constituency of Mr. Singh, a former M.P. Chief Minister and senior the Congress leader. Singh is challenging the sitting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Rodmal Nagar. Madhya Pradesh Guna and Rajgarh Lok Sabha constituencies will go to the polls in the third phase on May 7. ‘Back door entry'' At poll rallies in Madhya Pradesh Guna and Rajgarh Lok Sabha constituencies, Singh launched scathing attacks against the Congress over issues ranging from the abrogation of Article 370 and the Ram Temple to Naxalism and terrorism. the Congress wants to bring in Sharia law through the back door by talking about personal law. And Diggi Raja [a popular moniker for Singh] is two steps ahead and talks about bhagwa atankwad (saffron terrorism), Singh said. He [Mr. Singh] addresses Pakistani terrorist Hafiz Saeed as ‘sahib''. Singh] embraces Zakir Naik. Singh] opposes the death penalty to Afzal Guru who attacked the Parliament and also opposes the ban on the PFI [Popular Front of India], Singh said. Mr. Singh, a former M.P. Chief Minister and senior Congress leader also claimed that Madhya Pradesh had suffered from Naxalism during Mr. Singh, a former M.P. Chief Minister and senior Congress leader's tenure as CM between 1993 and 2003, adding that it was the the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government which has now eradicated Naxalism from Madhya Pradesh. ‘Home turf'' Mr. Shah also took some potshots at Singh for returning to Singh's home parliamentary constituency after 30 years. Mr. Singh, a former M.P. Chief Minister and senior Congress leader, who hails from the royal family of Rajgarh Lok Sabha's Raghogarh, had represented Rajgarh, the home constituency of Mr. Singh, a former M.P. Chief Minister and senior Congress leader from 1984-89 and 1991-94. What mandate are Mr. Singh, a former M.P. Chief Minister and senior Congress leader asking for Singh]? Mr. Singh, a former M.P. Chief Minister and senior Congress leader ran away for so many years, went to Bhopal and now Mr. Singh, a former M.P. Chief Minister and senior Congress leader have returned to Rajgarh Lok Sabha. Ask the people here if they want Mr. Singh, a former M.P. Chief Minister and senior Congress leader? Singh said, adding that the word bantadhar (ruined) has been added to Diggi Raja [a popular moniker for Mr. Singh]'s name. Singh] has come and gone many times. Now the time has come to give Singh] a permanent farewell from politics. People of Rajgarh Lok Sabha have to do it, Singh] said. You have to ensure Singh]'s defeat with a huge margin of votes. Defeat Singh] with a lead [matching] Singh]'s stature and make Singh] sit at home, Singh] added. Singh has already announced that this will be Singh's last election as Singh will soon cross the age of 80 years."
